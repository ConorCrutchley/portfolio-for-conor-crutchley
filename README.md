## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

- Node.js v24 or higher
- npm installed globally

Steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConorCrutchley/portfolio-for-conor-crutchley.git
cd portfolio-for-conor-crutchley
npm install
npm run dev # start local dev server
```

---

## Usage

Once running locally, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

---

## Build & Deployment

```bash
npm run build       # builds optimized production version
npm run preview     # preview production locally
```

To deploy, this uses **Vercel**. The deployment steps are: … (if applicable)

---

## Code Quality

- **Linting**: `npm run lint` runs ESLint with config in `eslint.config.mjs`
- **Formatting**: `prettier` settings in `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore` etc.
- Rules:
  - Components use PascalCase in file names and exported names.
  - CSS file names, CSS classes, and image file names use kebab-case.
  - CSS module file names end with module.css.
  - Model file names end with .model.ts
  - Variables and other file names use camelCase.
  - Image file names provide a description of what the image is which can be used for the alt text.

---

## Performance & Accessibility

- Performed audits with Lighthouse
- Optimized images & fonts
- Semantic HTML & keyboard navigation support
- ARIA attributes where needed

---

## Known Issues & Roadmap

- Memory usage can be quite high, especially if the site has been open for a while.
- Ocassionally, elements that use CSS transforms in animations can appear out of place. This may just be in development though after a large period of time developing.
- There's currently no toggle for light / dark mode, this could be a feature to add in the future.
- There's a limit on how many emails can be sent per month for free using email js. Whilst this is a small site and it should be ok, if someone were to spam the form with emails, it could prevent receiving genuine emails when a user fills in the form. Need to put in deterrents to prevent spam and potentially look into other forms of sending the email.
